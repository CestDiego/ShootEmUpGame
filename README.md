This is my own implementation of a classic shooting game called Space Invaders. The player must shoot all the invaders before they reach the player to win. The invaders randomly keep shooting the player and slowly move towards the player. 
This my first ever real-time action game using pure Vanilla JavaScript without any libraries and game engines. The main goals behind this projects were to pick up higher-level problem solving skills that involve thinking more about time and space. Also, to dig deeper into JavaScript inheritance and ES6/ES7, and learn more about functional inheritance as proposed by Crockford in his book - JavaScript the Good Parts. This game can be extended using tracking.js, a computer vision library, to control the player using hand movements; a human Nintendo Wii so to speak;
